# ArgentinaZikaForecating2019
The purpose of this project is to determine if there is a strong correlation between precipitation and the 2016-2017 zika outbreak

# Data Organization
Zika data is stored in the zika\_data directory. Files in the zika\_data directory are aggregated by month, and raw files are grouped by month in the subdirectories of the zika\_data directory

Precipitation data is stored in the raw\_data directory, and also in the data.zip file in the top-level directory.

Shapefiles for the provinces of Argentina are located in the shapefiles directory

Scripts/Jupyter notebooks used for analysis are located in the top-level directory.
